## Running the script in your terminal:
1. cd into the location where you saved the perl script
> cd /Desktop/Sandbox

2. run the perl script
> perl KL.pl

3. the script will ask you to give the input folder's path name. It is recommended that you create a folder 'in' and put the input files you want ran.
Prompt:
"Give the input folder's path name "
> /Users/Desktop/in


## After running the script:
You will be getting one output per input file and one file for summary. For 01.in you will be getting  01.out and for 02.in and 02.out

- the 01.out will contain the final cut and the partition assignment of Node 1 to Node n
- the summary.out will contain the input file's initial cutsize, initial execution time in calculating initial cutsize, final cutsize and time elapsed for the final cutsize
